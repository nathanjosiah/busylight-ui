# Busylight UI

## Summary
UI for the Kuando Busylight. Built for my Omega on Mac but probably works fine with other combinations.

* Supports automatic switching from Green to Red when a Microsoft Teams meeting is active. 
* Allows manual override of active color (or Off) 
* Automatic after-hour and weekend switching to "Off"

## Install

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python3 busy.py`
